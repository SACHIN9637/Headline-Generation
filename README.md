# 📰 Headline Generation using Self-Attention Based Models

This project focuses on generating headlines from textual content using deep learning models based on the self-attention mechanism. It leverages the power of transformers to understand the context and generate meaningful titles.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build and evaluate a model capable of summarizing articles into concise and relevant headlines using self-attention-based architectures.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `models/` - Pre-trained models or scripts to build and train the headline generation model.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for code implementation and experimentation.
- `outputs/` - Directory for storing generated headlines and evaluation results.
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file).

## 🧠 Model Description

The model used in this project is based on transformer architectures that utilize self-attention mechanisms to understand long-term dependencies in text. The typical pipeline includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Preparing text data for model training.
2. **Tokenization and Embedding**: Breaking text into tokens and converting them into embeddings.
3. **Sequence-to-Sequence Model with Self-Attention Layers**: Using architectures like Transformer or BERT for the task of headline generation.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on the preprocessed data and evaluating its performance.
